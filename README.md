# Bulls and Cows Game Project

## Game Description
In each round of the Bulls and Cows game, the computer generates a secret non-repeating 4 digit
number such as **4971** with the player trying to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. 
After each player guess, the computer will provide feedback indicating how many digits in the
guess matched the same digit <u>and</u> position in the secret number ("Bulls") and how many digits 
in the guess matched the same digit, but not the same position in the secret number ("Cows"). 

## Game Interface Prototype Example
<pre><b>In the Bulls and Cows game, the computer generates a secret non-repeating 4 digit
code with the player trying to guess the code in as few attempts as possible.

After the player guesses, the computer will provide feedback indicating how many digits in
the guess matched the same digit and position in the secret code ('Bulls') and how many digits
matched digits in the secret code, but are not in the matching position ('Cows'). 

Let's Play Bulls and Cows

Enter guess #1: 1234
-> RESULTS: 0 Bull(s) 0 Cow(s)
Enter guess #2: 5678
-> RESULTS: 1 Bull(s) 3 Cow(s)
Enter guess #3: 5876
-> RESULTS: 2 Bull(s) 2 Cow(s)
Enter guess #4: 5867
-> RESULTS: 1 Bull(s) 3 Cow(s)
Enter guess #5: 5786
-> RESULTS: 4 Bull(s) 0 Cow(s)

Congratulations! You broke the code in 5 guesses.

Play another round (y/n): N

Thanks for playing!
