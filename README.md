# Bulls and Cows Game Project

## Game Description
In each round of the Bulls and Cows game, the computer generates a secret non-repeating 4 digit
number such as **4971** with the player trying to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. 
After each player guess, the computer will provide feedback indicating how many digits in the
guess matched the same digit <u>and</u> position in the secret number ("Bulls") and how many digits 
in the guess matched the same digit, but not the same position in the secret number ("Cows").
